# How to Contribute

You want Hacktoberfest points. I want to avoid getting spammed.

We all want simple resources that will help us learn and grow as a developer community.

A couple of ground rules to contribute.

1. **Please don't ask to be assigned an issue.** 
    - Just pick an issue and go for it. I will make sure everyone who puts in earnest effort will get the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label on their PR. I'll do my best to pick solutions that are the best fit for the project at the time for merge.
2. **Please be patient** 
    - This is my first time maintaining a project. I'm open to suggestions to improve everyone's experience/ability to contribute in some way, but please be respectful to me and others.
3. **Use the open source standard**
    - Fork your own copy of the repo, branch off and make PRs from there. Use this handy [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github). Replacing instructions for `master` with `main`.
4. **Make an honest effort**
    - You can stray from the set issues, just make sure the change adds value. Unnecessary spelling changes or additions in the documentation of this repo will not be counted towards your hacktoberfest PRs. 
    If you're adding languages or tasks in the README, it must at least accompany the addition of a corresponding task in that language.
